# Virtual_sampling_technique
This code will generate spectrogram images by varying the sampling rate both upward and downward without altering the original signal. By adjusting the sampling rate in this manner, the spectrogram patterns at specific frequency bands shift correspondingly. This process allows for the creation of a large number of images, which can then be used to effectively train transfer learning models.
